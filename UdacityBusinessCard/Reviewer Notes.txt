Hello sir
1)	I was thinking that which organisation should i choose to make the business card. So the best thing that came to my mind was Udacity itself.
	I have picked up the tag line from the site and logos of the companies with whom udacity is collaborated.
  
2)	I have used relative and linear view groups and even button in such a way that my app looks perfect in portrait mode as well as in landscape mode.

3)	I took the address,phone number and website from the internet so I can't tell about its authenticty.

4)	In addtion I was very much eager to make my app scroll and add app icon so I took reference from different forums.

I hope you would like my App.
